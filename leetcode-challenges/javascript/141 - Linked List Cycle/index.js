/**
 * 141 - Linked List Cycle (https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/submissions/)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by
 * continuously following the next pointer.
 * Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to.
 *
 * Note: that pos is not passed as a parameter.
 *
 * Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
